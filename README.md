# definitelynotstandard

Definitely not a standard JavaScript linter. No rules, just right.

## Uggh Opinions

Are you tired of linters with all their _opinions_. Tired of using linters so that you stop debating about style in PRs, only to find yourself debating about which linter or linting rules to use? 

Now you can finally use a linter that _just works_. Want semicolons? Add semicolons! No semicolons? Who cares! 80 chars per line? Sure! 120 chars? Whatever!

`definitelynotstandard` is the only linter that comes with no rules so just do what you want. 

## Usage

```bash
definitelynotstandard index.js --fix
```

`definitelynotstandard` uses the `standard-engine` and accepts all options used by the `standard` CLI.

## See Rule You Want To Add?

Too bad.
